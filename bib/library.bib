 , abstract = {Issues of feasibility and stability are considered for a finite horizon formulation of receding horizon control for linear systems under mixed linear state and control constraints. We prove that given any compact set of initial conditions that is feasible for the infinite horizon problem, there exists a finite horizon length above which a receding horizon policy will provide both feasibility and stability, even when no end or stability constraint is imposed. Finally, computations for determining a sufficient horizon length are carried out on a simple open-loop stable example under control saturation constraints.}

@article{CHEN1998,
abstract = {We present in this paper a novel nonlinear model predictive control scheme that guarantees asymptotic closed-loop stability. The scheme can be applied to both stable and unstable systems with input constraints. The objective functional to be minimized consists of an integral square error (ISE) part over a finite time horizon plus a quadratic terminal cost. The terminal state penalty matrix of the terminal cost term has to be chosen as the solution of an appropriate Lyapunov equation. Furthermore, the setup includes a terminal inequality constraint that forces the states at the end of the finite prediction horizon to lie within a prescribed terminal region. If the Jacobian linearization of the nonlinear system to be controlled is stabilizable, we prove that feasibility of the open-loop optimal control problem at time t=0 implies asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. The size of the region of attraction is only restricted by the requirement for feasibility of the optimization problem due to the input and terminal inequality constraints and is thus maximal in some sense.},

@article{Richalet1978,
abstract = {A new method of digital process control is described. It relies on three principles: 1. (a) The multivariable plant is represented by its impulse responses which will be used on line by the control computer for long range prediction; 2. (b) The behavior of the closed-loop system is prescribed by means of reference trajectories initiated on the actual outputs; 3. (c) The control variables are computed in a heuristic way with the same procedure used in identification, which appears as a dual of the control under this formulation. This method has been continuously and successfully applied to a dozen large scale industrial processes for more than a year's time. Its effectiveness is due to the ease of its implementation (e.g. constraints on the control variables) and to its amazing robustness as concerns structural perturbations. The economics of this control scheme is eloquent and figures can be put forward to demonstrate its efficiency. Optimality does not come from extraneous criteria on the control actions but from minimization of the error variance which permits computation of the set points of the dynamic control in a hierarchical way.},

@book{Lumelsky2005,
abstract = {A leap forward in the field of robotics Until now, most of the advances in robotics have taken place in structured environments. Scientists and engineers have designed highly sophisticated robots, but most are still only able to operate and move in predetermined, planned environments designed specifically for the robots and typically at very high cost. This new book takes robotics to the next level by setting forth the theory and techniques needed to achieve robotic motion in unstructured environments. The ability to move and operate in an arbitrary, unplanned environment will lead to automating a wide range of new robotic tasks, such as patient care, toxic site cleanup, and planetary exploration. The approach that opens the door for robots to handle unstructured tasks is known as Sensing-Intelligence-Motion (SIM), which draws from research in topology, computational complexity, control theory, and sensing hardware. Using SIM as an underlying foundation, the author's carefully structured presentation is designed to: * Formulate the challenges of sensor-based motion planning and then build a theoretical foundation for sensor-based motion planning strategies * Investigate promising algorithmic strategies for mobile robots and robot arm manipulators, in both cases addressing motion planning for the whole robot body * Compare robot performance to human performance in sensor-based motion planning to gain better insight into the challenges of SIM and help build synergistic human-robot teams for tele-operation tasks. It is both exciting and encouraging to discover that robot performance decisively exceeds human performance in certain tasks requiring spatial reasoning, even when compared to trained operators * Review sensing hardware that is necessary to realize the SIM paradigm Some 200 illustrations, graphic sketches, and photos are included to clarify key issues, develop and validate motion planning approaches, and demonstrate full systems in operation. As the first book fully devoted to robot motion planning in unstructured environments, Sensing, Intelligence, Motion is a must-read for engineers, scientists, and researchers involved in robotics. It will help them migrate robots from highly specialized applications in factories to widespread use in society where autonomous robot motion is needed.},

abstract = {In this paper, a nonlinear model predictive tracking (NMPT) controller for mobile robots is presented. The basic idea is to use a motion model for the vehicle and compute in real-time an optimal M-step-ahead control sequence, which minimizes the total M+l step tracking error of the projected motion. In the presence of obstacles, the controller deviates from the reference trajectory by incorporating into the optimization obstacle-distance information from range sensors (e.g., laser scanner, ultrasound). Numerous simulations were performed and the NMPT consistently converged to the desired trajectories and followed them accurately, despite large initial errors and discontinuities in the desired velocities and orientations. The controller's performance depended strongly on parameters such as the optimization horizon M, and the cost-weights assigned to the various tracking errors. The optimization horizon regulates a trade-off between timely obstacle avoidance and tracking quality (large M) vs. consistently fast convergence (small M). The cost-weights affect tracking quality and also the shape of the path, by regulating trade-offs among position, orientation, and velocity errors. Overall, NMPT seems to offer a promising approach for advanced precision guidance applications, and deserves further investigation.},

abstract = {Clean code that works--now. This is the seeming contradiction that lies behind much of the pain of programming. Test-driven development replies to this contradiction with a paradox--test the program before you write it. A new idea? Not at all. Since the dawn of computing, programmers have been specifying the inputs and outputs before programming precisely. Test-driven development takes this age-old idea, mixes it with modern languages and programming environments, and cooks up a tasty stew guaranteed to satisfy your appetite for clean code that works--now. Developers face complex programming challenges every day, yet they are not always readily prepared to determine the best solution. More often than not, such difficult projects generate a great deal of stress and bad code. To garner the strength and courage needed to surmount seemingly Herculean tasks, programmers should look to test-driven development (TDD), a proven set of techniques that encourage simple designs and test suites that inspire confidence. By driving development with automated tests and then eliminating duplication, any developer can write reliable, bug-free code no matter what its level of complexity. Moreover, TDD encourages programmers to learn quickly, communicate more clearly, and seek out constructive feedback. Readers will learn to: Solve complicated tasks, beginning with the simple and proceeding to the more complex. Write automated tests before coding. Grow a design organically by refactoring to add design decisions one at a time. Create tests for more complicated logic, including reflection and exceptions. Use patterns to decide what tests to write. Create tests using xUnit, the architecture at the heart of many programmer-oriented testing tools. This book follows two TDD projects from start to finish, illustrating techniques programmers can use to easily and dramatically increase the quality of their work. The examples are followed by references to the featured TDD patterns and refactorings. With its emphasis on agile methods and fast development strategies, "Test-Driven Development" is sure to inspire readers to embrace these under-utilized but powerful techniques. 0321146530B10172002},

abstract = {Functional reactive programming, or FRP, is a style of programming based on two key ideas: continuous time-varying behaviors, and event-based reactivity. FRP is the essence of Fran [1,2], a domain-specific language for functional reactive graphics and animation, and has recently been used in the design of Frob [3,4], a domain-specific language for functional vision and robotics. In general, FRP can be viewed as an interesting language for describing hybrid systems, which are systems comprised of both analog (continuous) and digital (discrete) subsystems. Continuous behaviors can be thought of simply as functions from time to some value: Behavior a = Time -{\textgreater} a. For example: an image behavior may represent an animation; a Cartesian-point behavior may be a mouse; a velocity-vector behavior may be the control vector for a robot; and a tuple-of-distances behavior may be the input from a robot's sonar array. Both continuous behaviors and event-based reactivity have interesting pro erties worthy of independent study, but their integration is particularly interesting. At the core of the issue is that events are intended to cause discrete shifts in declarative behavior; i.e. not just shifts in the state of reactivity. Being declarative, the natural desire is for everything to be first-class and higher-order. But this causes interesting clashes in frames of reference, especially when time and space transformations are applied. In this talk the fundamental ideas behind FRP are presented, along with a discussion of various issues in its formal semantics. This is joint work with Conal Elliot at Microsoft Research, and John Peterson at Yale.},

Our aim is to design automatic adaptation strategies of the optimization horizon in order to guarantee stability and a predefined degree of suboptimality for the closed loop solution. Here, we present a stability proof for an arbitrary adaptation scheme and state a simple shortening and prolongation strategy which can be used for adapting the optimization horizon.},

The primitives are pre-computed to meet two objective: to capture the mobility constraints of the robot as well as possible and to establish a state sampling policy that is conductive to efficient search. The first objective allows encoding mobility constraints into primitives, thereby enabling fast unconstrained search to produce feasible solutions. The second objective enables high quality (lattice) sampling of state space, further speeding up exploration during search. We further discuss several novel results enabled by using such motion primitives for kinodynamic planning, including incremental search, efficient bi-directional search and incremental sampling.},

The modeling goal is to produce a mathematical description in nonlinear state-space form that is suitable for control-oriented model analysis and preliminary controller design experiments. The proposed model takes temperature effects and xenon poisoning into consideration and thus it is an extension of formerly published simpler model structures. Real transient measurement data from the plant has been used for the identification that is based on standard prediction error minimization. It is shown that the model is fairly well identifiable and the newly inserted model components significantly improve the quality of fit between the measured and computed model outputs.

@book{Fowler1999,
abstract = {As the application of object technology-particularly the Java programming language-has become commonplace, a new problem has emerged to confront the software development community. Significant numbers of poorly designed programs have been created by less-experienced developers, resulting in applications that are inefficient and hard to maintain and extend. Increasingly, software system professionals are discovering just how difficult it is to work with these inherited, "non-optimal" applications. For several years, expert-level object programmers have employed a growing collection of techniques to improve the structural integrity and performance of such existing software programs. Referred to as "refactoring," these practices have remained in the domain of experts because no attempt has been made to transcribe the lore into a form that all developers could use. . .until now. In Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Software, renowned object technology mentor Martin Fowler breaks new ground, demystifying these master practices and demonstrating how software practitioners can realize the significant benefits of this new process. With proper training a skilled system designer can take a bad design and rework it into well-designed, robust code. In this book, Martin Fowler shows you where opportunities for refactoring typically can be found, and how to go about reworking a bad design into a good one. Each refactoring step is simple-seemingly too simple to be worth doing. Refactoring may involve moving a field from one class to another, or pulling some code out of a method to turn it into its own method, or even pushing some code up or down a hierarchy. While these individual steps may seem elementary, the cumulative effect of such small changes can radically improve the design. Refactoring is a proven way to prevent software decay. In addition to discussing the various techniques of refactoring, Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Software provides a detailed catalog of more than seventy proven refactorings with helpful pointers that teach you when to apply them; step-by-step instructions for applying each refactoring; and an example illustrating how the refactoring works. The illustrative examples are written in Java, but the ideas are applicable to any object-oriented programming language.},

Although such robustness would be desirable in engineered systems, most machines fail in the face of unexpected damage.

A four-legged machine uses actuation-sensation relationships to indirectly infer its own structure, and it then uses this self-model to generate forward locomotion. When a leg part is removed, it adapts the self-models, leading to the generation of alternative gaits. This concept may help develop more robust machines and shed light on self-modeling in animals.},

A multi-layer back-propagation neural network is employed to model non-linear kinematics of the robot instead of a linear regression estimator in order to adapt the robot to a large operating range. The neural predictive control for path tracking is a model-based predictive control based on neural network modelling, which can generate its output in terms of the robot kinematics and a desired path. The desired path for the robot is produced by a polar polynomial with a simple closed form. The multi-layer back-propagation neural network is constructed by a wavelet orthogonal decomposition to form a wavelet neural network that can overcome the problem caused by the local minima when training the neural network. The wavelet neural network has the advantage of using an explicit way to determine the number of the hidden nodes and initial value of weights. Simulation results for the modelling and control are provided to justify the proposed scheme.},

An optimal tracking problem while avoiding collision with obstacles is formulated in terms of cost minimization under constraints. Information on obstacles is incorporated online in the nonlinear model-predictive framework as they are sensed within a limited sensing range. The overall problem is solved online with nonlinear programming. For the local path regeneration upon detecting new obstacles, the cost function is augmented using the obstacle information in two methods. The first method uses the distance from the UGV to the nearest detected obstacle, and the second method uses the parallax information from the vehicle about the detected obstacles. Simulation results in cluttered and dynamic environments show that the modified parallax method effectively reflects the threat of the obstacles to the UGV considering the dimension and state variables of the vehicle, showing clear improvements over the distance-based methods.},

@book{Siciliano2008,
abstract = {The classic text on robot manipulators now covers visual control, motion planning and mobile robots too! Robotics provides the basic know-how on the foundations of robotics: modelling, planning and control. The text develops around a core of consistent and rigorous formalism with fundamental and technological material giving rise naturally and with gradually increasing difficulty to more advanced considerations. The theory of manipulator structures presented in the early part of the book encompasses: • the fundamentals: kinematics, statics and trajectory planning; and • the technology of actuators, sensors and control units. Subsequently, more advanced instruction is given in: • dynamics and motion control of robot manipulators; • mobile robots; • motion planning; and • interaction with the environment using exteroceptive sensory data (force and vision). Appendices ensure that students will have access to a consistent level of background in basic areas such as rigid-body mechanics, feedback control, and others. Problems are raised and the proper tools established to find engineering-oriented solutions rather than to focus on abstruse theoretical methodology. To impart practical skill, more than 60 examples and case studies are carefully worked out and interwoven through the text, with frequent resort to simulation. In addition, nearly 150 end-of-chapter problems are proposed, and the book is accompanied by a solutions manual (downloadable from www.springer.com/978-1-84628-641-4) containing the MATLAB{\textregistered} code for computer problems; this is available free of charge to those adopting Robotics as a textbook for courses.

In the proposed method, the FOCP under consideration is reduced to a system of nonlinear algebraic equations which can be simply solved. To this end, the fractional derivative of the state variable and the control variable are expanded by the LWs with unknown coefficients. Then, the operational matrix of the Riemann–Liouville fractional integration with some properties of the LWs are employed to achieve a nonlinear algebraic equation, in place of the performance index and a linear system of algebraic equations, in place of the dynamical system in terms of the unknown coefficients. Finally, the method of constrained extrema, which consists of adjoining the constraint equations derived from the given dynamical system to the performance index by a set of undetermined Lagrange multipliers is applied. As a result, the necessary conditions of optimality are derived as a system of algebraic equations in the unknown coefficients of the state variable, control variable and Lagrange multipliers. Furthermore, the efficiency of the proposed method is shown for some concrete examples. The results reveal that the proposed method is very accurate and efficient.},

abstract = {A unified framework is presented for the numerical solution of optimal control problems using collocation at Legendre–Gauss (LG), Legendre–Gauss–Radau (LGR), and Legendre–Gauss–Lobatto (LGL) points. It is shown that the LG and LGR differentiation matrices are rectangular and full rank whereas the LGL differentiation matrix is square and singular. Consequently, the LG and LGR schemes can be expressed equivalently in either differential or integral form, while the LGL differential and integral forms are not equivalent. Transformations are developed that relate the Lagrange multipliers of the discrete nonlinear programming problem to the costates of the continuous optimal control problem. The LG and LGR discrete costate systems are full rank while the LGL discrete costate system is rank-deficient. The LGL costate approximation is found to have an error that oscillates about the true solution and this error is shown by example to be due to the null space in the LGL discrete costate system. An example is considered to assess the accuracy and features of each collocation scheme.},

For a broad class of options encountered in financial engineering we propose a solution to the problem of finding a hedging portfolio using a discrete-time stochastic model predictive control and receding horizon optimization. By employing existing option pricing engines for estimating future option prices (possibly in an approximate way, to increase computation speed), in the absence of transaction costs the resulting stochastic optimization problem is easily solved at each trading date as a least-squares problem with as many variables as the number of traded assets and as many constraints as the number of predicted scenarios. As shown through numerical examples, the approach is particularly useful and numerically viable for exotic options where closed-form results are not available, as well as relatively long expiration dates where tree-based stochastic approaches are ...},

The modeling goal is to produce a mathematical description in nonlinear state-space form that is suitable for control-oriented model analysis and preliminary controller design experiments. The proposed model takes temperature effects and xenon poisoning into consideration and thus it is an extension of formerly published simpler model structures. Real transient measurement data from the plant has been used for the identification that is based on standard prediction error minimization. It is shown that the model is fairly well identifiable and the newly inserted model components significantly improve the quality of fit between the measured and computed model outputs.

Receding horizon control (RHC) has a number of advantages over other types of control: easier computation than steady-state optimal control; greater adaptability to parametric changes than infinite horizon control; better tracking than PID and good constraint handling among others. The text builds understanding starting with optimal controls for simple linear systems and working through constrained systems to nonlinear cases. RHC is applied to discrete-time systems for better understanding and easier computer application. Its diverse techniques are unified using the state-space framework. Worked examples and exercises throughout the book allow you to practise as you go and MATLAB{\textregistered} files for the solution of selected examples can be downloaded from springeronline.com. Graduate students following masters and doctoral courses in control theory and engineering will find Receding Horizon Control to be an excellent companion to tuition and research.

We consider inherent robustness properties of model predictive control (MPC) for continuous-time nonlinear systems with input constraints and terminal constraints. We show that when the linear quadratic control law is chosen as the terminal control law, and the related Lyapunov matrix is chosen as the terminal penalty matrix, MPC with nominal prediction model and bounded disturbances has some degree of inherent robustness. We emphasize that the input constraint sets can be any compact set rather than convex sets, and our results do not rely on the continuity of the optimal cost functional or control law in the interior of the feasible region.},

abstract = {Model predictive control is a form of control in which the current control action is obtained by solving, at each sampling instant, a finite horizon open-loop optimal control problem, using the current state of the plant as the initial state; the optimization yields an optimal control sequence and the first control in this sequence is applied to the plant. An important advantage of this type of control is its ability to cope with hard constraints on controls and states. It has, therefore, been widely applied in petro-chemical and related industries where satisfaction of constraints is particularly important because efficiency demands operating points on or close to the boundary of the set of admissible states and controls. In this review, we focus on model predictive control of constrained systems, both linear and nonlinear and discuss only briefly model predictive control of unconstrained nonlinear and/or time-varying systems. We concentrate our attention on research dealing with stability and optimality; in these areas the subject has developed, in our opinion, to a stage where it has achieved sufficient maturity to warrant the active interest of researchers in nonlinear control. We distill from an extensive literature essential principles that ensure stability and use these to present a concise characterization of most of the model predictive controllers that have been proposed in the literature. In some cases the finite horizon optimal control problem solved on-line is exactly equivalent to the same problem with an infinite horizon; in other cases it is equivalent to a modified infinite horizon optimal control problem. In both situations, known advantages of infinite horizon optimal control accrue.},

abstract = {Template metaprogramming is an emerging new direction of generative programming. With the clever definitions of templates we can force the C++ compiler to execute algorithms at compilation time. Among the application areas of template metaprograms are the expression templates, static interface checking, code optimization with adaption, language embedding and active libraries. However, as template metaprogramming was not an original design goal, the C++ language is not capable of elegant expression of metaprograms. The complicated syntax leads to the creation of code that is hard to write, understand and maintain. Although template metaprogramming has a strong relationship with functional programming, this is not reflected in the language syntax and existing libraries. In this paper we give a short and incomplete introduction to C++ templates and the basics of template metaprogramming. We will enlight the role of template metaprograms, and some important and widely used idioms. We give an overview of the possible application areas as well as debugging and profiling techniques. We suggest a pure functional style programming interface for C++ template metaprograms in the form of embedded Haskell code which is transformed to standard compliant C++ source.},

abstract = {Even bad code can function. But if code isn't clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn't have to be that way. Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship . Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code "on the fly" into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer--but only if you work at it. What kind of work will you be doing? You'll be reading code--lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what's right about that code, and what's wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft.Clean Code is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code--of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and "smells" gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code. Readers will come away from this book understandingHow to tell the difference between good and bad code How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes How to format code for maximum readability How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic How to unit test and practice test-driven development This book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.},

After a brief presentation of the basic principle of predictive control we outline some of the theoretical, computational, and implemen-tational aspects of this control strategy. Most of the theoretical developments in the area of NMPC are based on the assumption that the full state is available for measurement, an assumption that does not hold in the typical practical case. Thus, in the second part of this paper we focus on the output feedback problem in NMPC. After a brief overview on existing output feedback NMPC approaches we derive conditions that guarantee stability of the closed-loop if an NMPC state feedback controller is used together with a full state observer for the recovery of the system state.},

An optimal state-feedback law is determined so that a receding-horizon performance index with a moving terminal time is minimized. It is shown that the receding-horizon control problem can be converted to an initial-value problem for an ordinary differential equation that can be solved numerically without recourse to iterative methods. The proposed solution technique is applied to a control experiment on a simplified space-vehicle model. The penalty-function approach is employed in the performance index so that the space-vehicle model attains the objective state, avoiding an obstacle. The model is controlled successfully at the sampling frequency of 30 Hz in the hardware experiment.},

abstract = {Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is widely used in the process and chemical industries and increasingly for applications, such as those in the automotive industry, which use higher data sampling rates. Nonlinear Model Predictive Control is a thorough and rigorous introduction to NMPC for discrete-time and sampled-data systems. NMPC is interpreted as an approximation of infinite-horizon optimal control so that important properties like closed-loop stability, inverse optimality and suboptimality can be derived in a uniform manner. These results are complemented by discussions of feasibility and robustness. NMPC schemes with and without stabilizing terminal constraints are detailed and intuitive examples illustrate the performance of different NMPC variants. An introduction to nonlinear optimal control algorithms gives insight into how the nonlinear optimisation routine – the core of any NMPC controller – works. An appendix covering NMPC software and accompanying software in MATLAB{\textregistered} and C++(downloadable from www.springer.com/ISBN) enables readers to perform computer experiments exploring the possibilities and limitations of NMPC. Nonlinear Model Predictive Control is primarily aimed at academic researchers and practitioners working in nonlinear control but the text is self-contained featuring background material on infinite-horizon optimal control and Lyapunov stability theory which makes the book accessible to graduate and advanced undergraduate students of control engineering and applied mathematics.},

We provide a set of conditions on the design parameters that permits to verify a priori the stabilizing properties of the control strategies considered. The supplied sufficient conditions for stability can also be used to analyse the stability of most previous MPC schemes. The class of nonlinear systems addressed is significantly enlarged by removing the traditional assumptions on the continuity of the optimal controls and on the stabilizability of the linearized system. Some important classes of nonlinear systems, including some nonholonomic systems, can now be stabilized by MPC. In addition, we can exploit increased flexibility in the choice of design parameters to reduce the constraints of the optimal control problem, and thereby reduce the computational effort in the optimization algorithms used to implement MPC.},

abstract = {The motion planning problem is of central importance to the fields of robotics, spatial planning, and automated design. In robotics we are interested in the automatic synthesis of robot motions, given high-level specifications of tasks and geometric models of the robot and obstacles. The “Movers'” problem is to find a continuous, collision-free path for a moving object through an environment containing obstacles. We present an implemented algorithm for the classical formulation of the three-dimensional Movers' problem: Given an arbitrary rigid polyhedral moving object P with three translational and three rotational degrees of freedom, find a continuous, collision-free path taking P from some initial configuration to a desired goal configuration. This paper describes an implementation of a complete algorithm (at a given resolution) for the full six degree of freedom Movers' problem. The algorithm transforms the six degree of freedom planning problem into a point navigation problem in a six-dimensional configuration space (called C-space). The C-space obstacles, which characterize the physically unachievable configurations, are directly represented by six-dimensional manifolds whose boundaries are five-dimensional C-surfaces. By characterizing these surfaces and their intersections, collision-free paths may be found by the closure of three operators which (i) slide along five-dimensional level C-surfaces parallel to C-space obstacles; (ii) slide along one- to four-dimensional intersections of level C-surfaces; and (iii) jump between six-dimensional obstacles. These operators are employed by a best-first search algorithm in C-space. We will discuss theoretical properties of the algorithm, including completeness (at a resolution). This paper describes the heuristic search, with particular emphasis on the heuristic strategies that evaluate local geometric information. At the heart of this paper lie the design and implementation of these strategies for planning paths along level C-surfaces and their intersection manifolds, and for reasoning about motions with three degrees of rotational freedom. The problems of controlling the interaction of these strategies, and of integrating diverse local experts for geometric reasoning provide an interesting application of search to a difficult domain with significant practical implications. The representations and algorithms we develop impact many geometric planning problems, and extend to Cartesian manipulators with six degrees of freedom.},

abstract = {Receding horizon feedback control (RHFC) was originally introduced as an easy method for designing stable state-feedback controllers for linear systems. Here those results are generalized to the control of nonlinear autonomous systems, and we develop a performance index which is minimized by the RHFC (inverse optimal control problem). Previous results for linear systems have shown that desirable nonlinear controllers can be developed by making the RHFC horizon distance a function of the state. That functional dependence was implicit and difficult to implement on-line. Here we develop similar controllers for which the horizon distance is an easily computed explicit function of the state.},

@article{Barraquand1991,
abstract = {We propose a new approach to robot path planning that consists of building and searching a graph connecting the local minima of a potential function defined over the robot's configuration space. A planner based on this approach has been implemented. This planner is consider ably faster than previous path planners and solves prob lems for robots with many more degrees of freedom (DOFs). The power of the planner derives both from the "good" properties of the potential function and from the efficiency of the techniques used to escape the local min ima of this function. The most powerful of these tech niques is a Monte Carlo technique that escapes local min ima by executing Brownian motions. The overall approach is made possible by the systematic use of distributed rep resentations (bitmaps) for the robot's work space and configuration space. We have experimented with the plan ner using several computer-simulated robots, including rigid objects with 3 DOFs (in 2D work space) and 6 DOFs (in 3D work space) and manipulator arms with 8, 10, and 31 DOFs (in 2D and 3D work spaces). Some of the most significant experiments are reported in this article.},

abstract = {The opportunities modern computer systems seem to offer for implementing highly sophisticated control systems are counterbalanced by the difficulties encountered in designing these systems. The traditional approach to designing software for control systems, which worked rather well when systems were small and their design was relatively straightforward, is progressively breaking down as a result of the ever more demanding requirements for these systems. To reduce the resulting complexity, two complementary solutions can be envisioned: relying on better Computer Aided Control Systems Design Environments, and making large real-time control software less complex by adopting a highly modular and expandible software architecture. This paper analyzes the problem and attempts to demonstrate that a solution of the second kind indeed exists. A description of the system's architecture developed by us (SPLICE) is given and illustrated with a simple example.},

We show that the control law is piece-wise linear and continuous for both the finite horizon problem (model predictive control) and the usual infinite time measure (constrained linear quadratic regulation). Thus, the on-line control computation reduces to the simple evaluation of an explicitly defined piecewise linear function. By computing the inherent underlying controller structure, we also solve the equivalent of the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation for discrete-time linear constrained systems. Control based on on-line optimization has long been recognized as a superior alternative for constrained systems. The technique proposed in this paper is attractive for a wide range of practical problems where the computational complexity of on-line optimization is prohibitive. It also provides an insight into the structure underlying optimization-based controllers.},

The parameter estimation routine employed guarantees non-increase of the estimation error vector. This means that the controller employs a process model which approaches that of the true system over time. These estimates are used to update the parameter uncertainty set at every time step, resulting in a gradual reduction in the conservative and/or computational effects of the incorporated robust features.},

For explicit one-step methods for ordinary differential equations we address the issue of consistent and fast generation of both forward and adjoint derivatives of dynamic process models according to the principle of Internal Numerical Differentiation. We discuss the applicability of the proposed methods at the example of three benchmark problems.

And then we present a variational pseudospectral method based on dual variational principles and pseudospectral approximations in order to transform the constrained LQ problem into standard linear complementary problems (LCPs) which can be solved easily. The proposed method is highly efficient due to the benefits of qualsilineaization techniques and the sparse and symmetric properties of coefficient matrixes obtained by variational principles. And solutions of high precisions can be obtained with few time nodes and boundary conditions can be prescribed because of pseudospectral approximations. Besides, extra costate estimations are not required simply because this method is constructed by dual variational principles. Several numerical examples are simulated and comparisons between different methods are offered to demonstrate effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method.},

Every chapter of this book contains excellent explanations and insights into the smaller but important decisions we continuously have to make when creating quality code and classes. Erich Gamma, IBM Distinguished Engineer Many teams have a master developer who makes a rapid stream of good decisions all day long. Their code is easy to understand, quick to modify, and feels safe and comfortable to work with. If you ask how they thought to write something the way they did, they always have a good reason. This book will help you become the master developer on your team. The breadth and depth of topics will engage veteran programmers, who will pick up new tricks and improve on old habits, while the clarity makes it accessible to even novice developers. Russ Rufer, Silicon Valley Patterns Group Many people don t realize how readable code can be and how valuable that readability is. Kent has taught me so much, I m glad this book gives everyone the chance to learn from him. Martin Fowler, chief scientist, ThoughtWorks Code should be worth reading, not just by the compiler, but by humans. Kent Beck distilled his experience into a cohesive collection of implementation patterns. These nuggets of advice will make your code truly worth reading. Gregor Hohpe, author of Enterprise Integration Patterns In this book Kent Beck shows how writing clear and readable code follows from the application of simple principles. Implementation Patterns will help developers write intention revealing code that is both easy to understand and flexible towards future extensions. A must read for developers who are serious about their code. Sven Gorts Implementation Patterns bridges the gap between design and coding. Beck introduces a new way of thinking about programming by basing his discussion on values and principles. Diomidis Spinellis, author of Code Reading and Code Quality Software Expert Kent Beck Presents a Catalog of Patterns Infinitely Useful for Everyday Programming Great code doesn t just function: it clearly and consistently communicates your intentions, allowing other programmers to understand your code, rely on it, and modify it with confidence. But great code doesn t just happen. It is the outcome of hundreds of small but critical decisions programmers make every single day. Now, legendary software innovator Kent Beck known worldwide for creating Extreme Programming and pioneering software patterns and test-driven development focuses on these critical decisions, unearthing powerful implementation patterns for writing programs that are simpler, clearer, better organized, and more cost effective. Beck collects 77 patterns for handling everyday programming tasks and writing more readable code. This new collection of patterns addresses many aspects of development, including class, state, behavior, method, collections, frameworks, and more. He uses diagrams, stories, examples, and essays to engage the reader as he illuminates the patterns. You ll find proven solutions for handling everything from naming variables to checking exceptions. This book covers The value of communicating through code and the philosophy behind patterns How and when to create classes, and how classes encode logic Best practices for storing and retrieving state Behavior: patterns for representing logic, including alternative paths Writing, naming, and decomposing methods Choosing and using collections Implementation pattern variations for use in building frameworks Implementation Patterns will help programmers at all experience levels, especially those who have benefited from software patterns or agile methods. It will also be an indispensable resource for development teams seeking to work together more efficiently and build more maintainable software. No other programming book will touch your day-to-day work more often.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an algorithm that drives a unicycle type robot to a desired path, including obstacle avoidance capabilities. The path-following control design relies on Lyapunov theory, backstepping techniques and deals explicitly with vehicle dynamics. Furthermore, it overcomes the initial condition constraints present in a number of path-following control strategies described in the literature. This is done by controlling explicitly the rate of progression of a "virtual target" to be tracked along the path; thus bypassing the problems that arise when the position of the path target point is simply defined as the closest point on the path. The obstacle avoidance part uses the Deformable Virtual Zone (DVZ) principle. This principle defines a safety zone around the vehicle in which the presence of an obstacle induces an "intrusion of information" that drives the vehicle reaction. The overall algorithm is combined with a guidance solution that embeds the path-following requirements in a desired intrusion information function, which steers the vehicle to the desired path while the DVZ ensures minimal contact with the obstacle, implicitly bypassing it. Simulation and experimental results illustrate the performance of the control system proposed.},

Can you get nearly instantaneous feedback when you do change it? Do you understand it? If the answer to any of these questions is no, you have legacy code, and it is draining time and money away from your development efforts. In this book, Michael Feathers offers start-to-finish strategies for working more effectively with large, untested legacy code bases. This book draws on material Michael created for his renowned Object Mentor seminars, techniques Michael has used in mentoring to help hundreds of developers, technical managers, and testers bring their legacy systems under control. The topics covered include: Understanding the mechanics of software change, adding features, fixing bugs, improving design, optimizing performance Getting legacy code into a test harness Writing tests that protect you against introducing new problems Techniques that can be used with any language or platform, with examples in Java, C++, C, and C{\#} Accurately identifying where code changes need to be made Coping with legacy systems that aren't object-oriented Handling applications that don't seem to have any structure This book also includes a catalog of twenty-four dependency-breaking techniques that help you work with program elements in isolation and make safer changes.},

abstract = {We consider nominal robustness of model predictive control for discrete-time nonlinear systems. We show, by examples, that when the optimization problem involves state constraints, or terminal constraints coupled with short optimization horizons, the asymptotic stability of the closed loop may have absolutely no robustness. That is to say, it is possible for arbitrarily small disturbances to keep the closed loop strictly inside the interior of the feasibility region of the optimization problem and, at the same time, far from the desired set point. This phenomenon does not occur when using model predictive control for linear systems with convex constraint sets. We emphasize that a necessary condition for the absence of nominal robustness in nonlinear model predictive control is that the value function and feedback law are discontinuous at some point(s) in the interior of the feasibility region.},

@article{Ostafew2016,
abstract = {This paper presents a Robust Constrained Learning-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (RC-LB-NMPC) algo- rithm for path-tracking in off-road terrain. For mobile robots, constraints may represent solid obstacles or localization limits. As a result, constraint satisfaction is required for safety. Constraint satisfaction is typically guaranteed through the use of accurate, a priori models or robust control. However, accurate models are generally not available for off-road operation. Furthermore, robust controllers are often conservative, since model uncertainty is not updated online. In this work our goal is to use learning to generate low-uncertainty, non-parametric models in situ. Based on these models, the predictive controller computes both linear and angular velocities in real-time, such that the robot drives at or near its capabilities while respecting path and localization constraints. Localization for the controller is provided by an on-board, vision-based mapping and navigation system enabling operation in large-scale, off-road environments. The paper presents experimental results, including over 5 km of travel by a 900 kg skid-steered robot at speeds of up to 2.0 m/s. The result is a robust, learning controller that provides safe, conservative control during initial trials when model uncertainty is high and converges to high-performance, optimal control during later trials when model uncertainty is reduced with experience.},

@book{Grune2011,
abstract = {Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) is widely used in the process and chemical industries and increasingly for applications, such as those in the automotive industry, which use higher data sampling rates. Nonlinear Model Predictive Control is a thorough and rigorous introduction to NMPC for discrete-time and sampled-data systems. NMPC is interpreted as an approximation of infinite-horizon optimal control so that important properties like closed-loop stability, inverse optimality and suboptimality can be derived in a uniform manner. These results are complemented by discussions of feasibility and robustness. NMPC schemes with and without stabilizing terminal constraints are detailed and intuitive examples illustrate the performance of different NMPC variants. An introduction to nonlinear optimal control algorithms gives insight into how the nonlinear optimisation routine – the core of any NMPC controller – works. An appendix covering NMPC software and accompanying software in MATLAB{\textregistered} and C++(downloadable from www.springer.com/ISBN) enables readers to perform computer experiments exploring the possibilities and limitations of NMPC. Nonlinear Model Predictive Control is primarily aimed at academic researchers and practitioners working in nonlinear control but the text is self-contained featuring background material on infinite-horizon optimal control and Lyapunov stability theory which makes the book accessible to graduate and advanced undergraduate students of control engineering and applied mathematics.},

abstract = {A new method of digital process control is described. It relies on three principles: 1. (a) The multivariable plant is represented by its impulse responses which will be used on line by the control computer for long range prediction; 2. (b) The behavior of the closed-loop system is prescribed by means of reference trajectories initiated on the actual outputs; 3. (c) The control variables are computed in a heuristic way with the same procedure used in identification, which appears as a dual of the control under this formulation. This method has been continuously and successfully applied to a dozen large scale industrial processes for more than a year's time. Its effectiveness is due to the ease of its implementation (e.g. constraints on the control variables) and to its amazing robustness as concerns structural perturbations. The economics of this control scheme is eloquent and figures can be put forward to demonstrate its efficiency. Optimality does not come from extraneous criteria on the control actions but from minimization of the error variance which permits computation of the set points of the dynamic control in a hierarchical way.},

abstract = {Abstract A stabilizing control design for general linear time varying systems is presented and analysed. The control is a state-feedback law with gains determined by a standard method employed in optimal regulator problems. The considered cost function is, however, dynamically redefined over a fixed depth horizon. The method is shown to yield a stable closed-loop system and computationally efficient recursions for the feedback gain are provided},
